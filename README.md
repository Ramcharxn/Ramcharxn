## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Data and ML Engineer passionate about building robust data pipelines, deploying scalable ML systems, and solving real-world problems using data. With hands-on experience in cloud-native architectures, ETL workflows, and machine learning, I’ve worked on high-impact projects in domains ranging from legacy modernization to time series forecasting and LLM-based applications.

## 🧠 What I Do

### 🔹 Data Engineering  
- Built ETL pipelines on AWS Glue, S3, and EMR to handle 500GB+ daily data  
- Migrated 5,000+ SAS lines to PySpark, reducing runtime by 40%  
- Modeled data using dbt, Redshift, and partitioned Parquet with predicate pushdown  
- Implemented streaming pipelines using Apache Kafka, Flink, and Kinesis Firehose

### 🔹 Data Science & Analytics  
- Built XGBoost and LSTM models for forecasting and regression tasks  
- Used SHAP, feature engineering, and anomaly detection for actionable insights  
- Designed dashboards and visualizations using Tableau, Power BI, and Seaborn

### 🔹 MLOps & ML Engineering  
- Tracked and deployed models with MLflow, Docker, and FastAPI  
- Integrated async ONNX-compiled models for faster inference  
- Reduced LLM inference cost by 75% using QLoRA and quantization  
- Worked with transformers, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
